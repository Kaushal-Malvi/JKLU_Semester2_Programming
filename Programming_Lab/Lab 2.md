# Lab 3 – C Loops

## Questions

1. Write a C program to print positive integers from 1 to 10.

2. Write a C program to print numbers in reverse order with a difference of 2.

   Example:
   Enter the upper value: 10  
   Output: 10 8 6 4 2 1

3. Write a C program to count the number of digits in a given integer.

   Example:
   Input: 3452  
   Output: Number of digits = 4

4. Write a C program to reverse a given integer.

   Example:
   Input: 876  
   Output: 678

5. Write a C program to print the sum of digits of a number using a for loop.

   Example:
   Given number: 14892  
   Output: 1 + 4 + 8 + 9 + 2 = 24

6. Write a C program to check whether a number is a Palindrome or not.

   Example:
   Input: 151  
   Output: Palindrome Number

7. Write a C program to generate Fibonacci series.

   Example:
   Enter number of elements: 15  
   Output:  
   0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377

8. Write a C program to generate prime numbers between 1 and 10000.

9. Write a C program to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not.

   Note:  
   An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of the cubes of its digits.  
   Examples: 0, 1, 153, 370, 371, 407

10. Write a C program to check whether a given number is a Perfect number or not.

    Note:  
    A Perfect number is a positive integer equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.

    Example:  
    6 → Proper divisors: 1, 2, 3  
    Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6  
    Therefore, 6 is a Perfect number.

    Other examples: 28, 496
